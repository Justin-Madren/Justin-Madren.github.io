                Background in Games & Art
            </h3>
            <p>
                I have been playing video games since i was little and i got into are in my early teen's. 
                Game have taught me how to manage resorces, planing and critical thinking. Art has been
                somthing that is a different from what I do for school. Its allowes me to use my brain in a
                diffrent way compared to my other work. Together, gaming and art give me a way to relax,
                explore new ideas, and constantly challenge myself creatively.
