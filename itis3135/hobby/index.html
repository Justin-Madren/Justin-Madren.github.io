            <h3>Video Games Hobby</h3>
            <p>
                Video games is a interactive hobby where people use computers or game consoles like a PS5
                Nintendo Switch. They are used to engage with the digital world. Games combine art,
                storytelling, music and technology to create immersive and fun experiences that can range
                from a futuristic spy thriller to a fantasy setting to a modern day setting. There are
                many kinds of games for simple phone games like candy crush to first person shooter like
                Battle Field 6 to story driven games like Persona 5. Many enjoy the verity, challenge and
                creative that games provide. It's a hobby that continues to grow as technology grows.
            </p>
            <h3>Art Hobby</h3>
            <p>
                Art is a creative hobby where people use many mediums like drawing either traditional or
                degitaly. Working with wood and stone and clay for sculpting and carving. It combines skill
                imagination and technique to make something for visual enjoyment that can be personal, shared
                with others or soled to make a living or as a side hustle. Many just enjoy art for the
                relaxation, self-expression and for the fun of it. As a hobby it grows as you explore and
                find new things that you enjoy learning a new medium and you improve the longer you do it.

                I am a 23 year old first generation college student meaning I am the first in my family to attend a
                four year university in pursuit of a bachelor's degree. My major is in cyber security and I am
                currently pursuing the early entry program that will allow me to start working on my masters degree
                while I am still working on my bachelor's. Also I am going to be working on a google cybersecurity

            </h3>
            <p>
                I have been playing video games since I was little and I got into it in my early teens.
                Games have taught me how to manage resources, planning and critical thinking. Art has been
                something that is different from what I do for school. It's allowed me to use my brain in a
                different way compared to my other work. Together, gaming and art give me a way to relax,
                explore new ideas, and constantly challenge myself creatively.

                Video Game Time
            </h3>
            <p>
                For Video Games the best time is during the last quarter of the year. Because that is
               when most of the big game releases happen but there are many others that happen through
               out the year that are smaller like indie games and double a games. Overall the best time
               to start is now there are many options of games so there is something out there for everyone.
               With how easy it is to find games on services like steam and looking up for suggestions online
               you can find something that you would enjoy.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Art Time
            </h3>
            <p>
                For Art just like Video Games the best time to start is now because there is no seasonal hindrance
                they will stop you from creating art. The only seasonal event that I know of that happens every year is
                inktober. Inktober is a ever every october where there are at most 31 art prompts that are given and you
                use that to creats a inked piece of are, inked meaning that you take it from a rough sketch and give it defined
                links like you would see for a coloring page. If you look up inktober you will find the prompts for the year and
                previous years and other peoples art that they have posted online. Besides the inktober art is something that can
                be enjoyed all year round you could draw or make whatever you want, if you want to make in session art for the
                holidays then do it if you want to draw your favorite characters then do it. Your only limit is what you can think up
                and create and that is the best part of art.

                Where to Game
             </h3>
             <p>
                If you are playing on a console or PC, the best place to set up is at a sturdy desk with a
                good monitor and plenty of space. A proper desk helps keep your setup organized
                and reduces strain during long gaming sessions. Lighting is also important a well-lit room
                helps prevent eye fatigue and makes your experience more enjoyable. For handheld
                systems, comfort becomes the main priority, so a cozy chair, couch, or recliner is ideal.
                You will want a place where you can lean back, relax and play for extended periods.
                Keeping a charger nearby and minimizing distractions can make handheld gaming even better.
                Ultimately, the best place to game is wherever you feel most comfortable and focused.
             </p>
             <h3>
                Where to Draw
             </h3>
             <p>
                The best location to draw depends on your medium and personal style, but comfort and focus
                are key. If you work digitally, a clean desk with a tablet, good lighting, and an ergonomic 
                chair will help you stay productive. For traditional artists using paper or canvas, a stable
                surface and a bright, natural light source are essential. Some artists prefer working
                by a window or in a quiet studio, while others draw best in cozy corners with music or
                background noise. It’s also helpful to keep your materials organized and within easy
                reach to avoid interruptions. Remember to take breaks and stretch often, especially
                during long drawing sessions. In the end, the best place to draw is anywhere that
                inspires creativity and helps you stay relaxed.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Below I have listed the main things that you need for these hobbies. For me I have a 150 page 8.5 x 11 layflat
                sketch book that I have been using for about 1 year now and it's mostly filled I have about maybe 25 to 30 pages left
                in it. I also have a samsung t6 for digital are but I also use it for taking notes in class I have had it for about 10
                months and I enjoy it greatly. It has been the easy what to get into digital art that I have tried it has made it
                simple and easy to work with and if you want to get into digital are I highly recommend a tablet. For consoles and computers
                I have a custom pc that I built back in 2020 and I have made some upgrades since then like the ram and storage. I also have
                a steam deck that I use for gaming while I am away from home its a handheld gaming device that is made by valve and has access
                to my steam library of games. Overall depending on what you want out of the hobby it can be expensive or cheep just look around
                for some good deals just to start to see if you like it.

                        I recomend for drawing a book/pad that is around 8.5 by 11 in
                        like a Master's Touch or a Strathmore

                        <summary>Tablet</summary>
                        Tablets are one the more expensive side of the hobby I personally
                        use a samsung t6 with infinity painter. There are also dedicated drawing
                        tables like huion and Wancom but they most of them need a computer to
                        function as well as an art program to run like krita. Depending on your
                        price range the tables are cheaper and provide more use cases that the
                        detected drawing tablets. So if you are looking to get into digital are I
                        recommend looking into a tablet.

                        There are 3 main consoles that you can pick from: xbox, playstation and nintendo.
                        Depending on what you want to play if there are exclusives on a console that you want
                        then go with that one. As of 2025 I recommend the playstation and the Nintendo consoles
                        because of the games that are on their platform.

                        There are a wide varieties of option for computer depending on what you are going to be
                        using it for. I recommend that depending on what you want to do with it either gaming
                        art or something else you should look into the recommended spec for it. After that if you
                        are more comfortable with computer technology I recommend building your on by picking out all
                        the parts that you need. But if you are not comfortable there are many places and websites
                        that provide that service either in a custom build or a prebuild.

                I personally enjoy RPG and FPS games I enjoy the story telling that RPG provides and the
                stimulation that FPS provides one that I am playing right now is dead zone rouge. Dead
                Zone Rouge is a rouge light fps that can be played by yourself or with friends. I do enjoy
                playing games like Balders Gate 3 by myself but with games like Helldivers 2 and Marvel Rivals
                they are much more enjoyable if I am playing with my friends. It is nice to just hop on call
                and chat while playing which is where my most fond memories are.

            <p>
                I enjoy drawing both traditionally and digitally, and I mostly focus on people and characters.
                I love experimenting with different styles to bring each character to life. A lot of my 
                inspiration comes from seeing other artists’ creativity and the unique ways they express
                themselves. Watching how others design, color, and shape their work motivates me to keep 
                improving my own. Art also helps me relax and clear my mind while still feeling productive. 
                Whether I’m sketching on paper or working on a digital piece.

            <p>
                For the web site I used chatGPT for forming the foundation of how to construct the page.
                Each page is in a section element with a id that is used in the navigation along with some simple
                JavaScript makes it seem like there are multiple HTML files but it is all just in one. The script
                just sets all the section to inactive hiding them so you can see them but for the home I have the
                class is active so it is visible by default when you open the web page. I also used it for the
                styling the biggest part was when I was trying to work with grid and flexbox but was getting errors
                so I used GPT to find a workaround so I could the images in my games and art page look like they are
                in a two by two grid. Also for question about styling like how to have specific element styled in a
                certain way like the logs below me with the links to the GPT logs.
