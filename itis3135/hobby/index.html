                Personal Background
            </h3>
            <p>
                I am a 23 year old first generation college student meaning I am the first in my family to attend a 
                four year university in pursuit of a bachelor's degree. My major is in cyber security and I am 
                curently presuing the early entry program that will allow me to start working on my masters degree
                while I am still working on my bachelor's. Also I am going to be working on a google cybersecurity

                Background in Games & Art
            </h3>
            <p>
                I have been playing video games since i was little and i got into are in my early teen's. 
                Game have taught me how to manage resorces, planing and critical thinking. Art has been
                somthing that is a different from what I do for school. Its allowes me to use my brain in a
                diffrent way compared to my other work. Together, gaming and art give me a way to relax,
                explore new ideas, and constantly challenge myself creatively.

                Best Time
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Video Game Time
            </h3>
            <p>For Video Games the best time is during the last quater of the year. Because that is 
               when most of the big game releces happen but there are many others that happen through
               out the year that are smaller like indie games and double a games. Overall the best time
               to start is now there are many options of games so there is somthing out there for everone.
               With how easy it is to find games on services like steam and looking up for sugestions online
               you can find somthing that you would enjoy.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Art Time
            </h3>
            <p>
                For Art just like Video Games the best time to start is now because there is no secional hindernteds
                they will stop you from creating art. The only secional event that I know of that happens every year is
                inktober. Inktober is a ever every october where there are at most 31 art promptes that are given and you 
                use that to creats a inked piece of are, inked meaning that you take it from a rough sketch and give it defined
                links like you would see for a coloring page. If you look up inktober you will find the promptes for the year and
                previous years and other peoples art that they have posted online. Besides the inktober art is somthing that can
                be enjoyed all year round you could draw or make what ever you want, if you want to make in seasion art for the 
                holidays then do it if you want to draw you favoret charteres then do it. You only linent is what you can think up
                and create and that is the best part of art.

                Where to Game
             </h3>
             <p>
                If you are playing on a console or PC, the best place to set up is at a sturdy desk with a
                good monitor and plenty of space. A proper desk helps keep your setup organized
                and reduces strain during long gaming sessions. Lighting is also important a well-lit room
                helps prevent eye fatigue and makes your experience more enjoyable. For handheld 
                systems, comfort becomes the main priority, so a cozy chair, couch, or recliner is ideal.
                You will want a place where you can lean back relax and play for extended periods. 
                Keeping a charger nearby and minimizing distractions can make handheld gaming even better. 
                Ultimately, the best place to game is wherever you feel most comfortable and focused.

             </p>
             <h3>
                Where to Draw
             </h3>
             <p>
                The best location to draw depends on your medium and personal style, but comfort and focus
                are key. If you work digitally, a clean desk with a tablet, good lighting, and an ergonomic
                chair will help you stay productive. For traditional artists using paper or canvas, a stable
                surface and a bright, natural light source are essential. Some artists prefer working 
                by a window or in a quiet studio, while others draw best in cozy corners with music or 
                background noise. Itâ€™s also helpful to keep your materials organized and within easy 
                reach to avoid interruptions. Remember to take breaks and stretch often, especially 
                during long drawing sessions. In the end, the best place to draw is anywhere that 
                inspires creativity and helps you stay relaxed.

                        I recomend for drawing a book/pad that is around 8.5 by 11 in

                        Tablets are one the more expencive side of the hobby I personaly
                        use a samsung t6 with infinty painter. There are also decated drawing
                        tables like huion and wancom but they most of them need a comupter to 
                        function as well as a art program to run like krita. Depending on your
                        price range the tables are cheeper and provide more use cases that the 
                        deatected drawling tablets. So if you are lookin to get into digatal are I 
                        recomend looking a tablets.

                        There are 3 main consoles that you can pick from xbox, playstation and nentendio. 
                        Depending on what you want to play if there are excluseves on a colsole that you want
                        then go with that one. As of 2025 I recomed the playstation and the nentedo consloes
                        because fo the games that are on there platform.

                        There are a wide verites of option for computer depending on what you are going to be
                        using it for. I recomdend that depending on what you want to do with it either gaming
                        art or somthing else you should look in to the recomended specked for it. After that if you
                        are more comfterable with computer teranolagy I recomdend building your on by picking out all
                        the parts that you need. But if you are not cumfterale there are many places and webscites 
                        that provide that service ether in a custom build or a prebuild.

                I personaly enjoy RPG and FPS games I enjoy the story telling that RPG provedes and the
                stimluation that FPS provides one that I am playing right know is dead zone rouge. Dead
                Zone Rouge is a rouge light fps that can be played by your self or with friends. I do enjoy 
                playing games like Balders Gate 3 by my self but with games like Helldivers 2 and Marval Rivles
                they are much more enjoyable if I am playing with my friends. It is nice to just hop on call

            </h3>
            <p>
                I enjoy drawing both traditionally and digitally, and I mostly focus on people and characters.
                I love experimenting with different styles to bring each character to life. A lot of my 
                inspiration comes from seeing other artistsâ€™ creativity and the unique ways they express
                themselves. Watching how others design, color, and shape their work motivates me to keep 
                improving my own. Art also helps me relax and clear my mind while still feeling productive. 
                Whether Iâ€™m sketching on paper or working on a digital piece.
