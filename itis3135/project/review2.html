            <p>
                Contrast is looks good everting is easy to see and read.
                I don't have much to add it looks good.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Stylesheets Evaluation
            </h3>
            <p>
                Because I can't see any of the files on you GitHub I do not know if your css is in a seperate
                style sheet witch is where it should be or if it's inbeded. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                CRAP Principles Evaluation
            </h3>
            <p>
                Contrast is good not much for me to say there. The repetition lookes good there is a consestent
                theme throught out the whole site. The alingemts and proximity looks good nothing is out of place but for the lessions
                page unlike the others it takes up the whole page that there is no navagation bar at the top and no footer other
                other than that everything else look good.

                good and has all the correct and need inforamtion.

                Your assignment may include unique requirements. Be sure to create a checklist based on the assignment

                If any part of the assignment seems to conflict with this checklist, ask for clarification in the class forums.

                Website has all the required pages a index/home and 4 others that are revelent to the client.
                There is a navagation bar that works and goes to all the other pages. It is just not on
                the lesson page as well as the footer. It's a little bare bones as of wright this and could 
                use more content ex.. adding free edcutional videos in the resorces page and giving more
                depth to the lession planes in the lesson page and well as adding the Study Tools page
                that is mentioned in the pratice page.
