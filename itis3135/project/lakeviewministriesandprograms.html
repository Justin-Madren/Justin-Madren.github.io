            <h2>Programs and Ministries</h2>
            <p>
                At Lakeview Community Church, our programs and ministries provide opportunities 
                for every member of our church family to grow in faith, build community, and serve 
                others. Whether you’re joining a women’s circle, men’s fellowship, youth group, or 
                one of our outreach and worship committees, each ministry offers a meaningful way to 
                connect with others and share God’s love. From Bible studies and music to community 
                service and fellowship, there’s a place for everyone to belong and make a difference.
