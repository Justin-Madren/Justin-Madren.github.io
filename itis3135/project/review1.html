            <ul>
                <li>Font sizes must be readable.</li>
                <li>Contrast should make text easy to read for all users.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Stylesheets</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the site’s shared stylesheet unless the assignment requires a unique one.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>CRAP Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Make important elements stand out.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Reuse colors, spacing, fonts, and layout patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything should line up cleanly.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related items should be grouped together.</li>

            <h3>
                Contrast & Readability Evaluation
            </h3>
            <p>
                For the Contrast everthing is very easly visable and easy on the eyes. All the colors
                are picked well with good readability. There is not much for me to add to the section it
                is very well done.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Stylesheets Evaluation
            </h3>
            <p>
                For the style sheet it is all in one called site.ccs in the client folder. I believe that 
                it should be in the styles folder but what you did is probley a better way to have them sorted.
            </p>
            <h3>
                CRAP Principles Evaluation
            </h3>
            <p>
                CRAP principles again the contrast it very well done everthing is easy to read and see. Repetition
                is also very well done with everthing being in one style sheet it is easer to matain that. Alignment
                everthing is places well with in the pages the only thins that I would change are the weekly challenges
                to have it centered as well are the weekly fitness video on the home page. Proximity all related items
                are next to eachother making it easy to understand what goes with what.

                Your assignment may include unique requirements. Be sure to create a checklist based on the assignment 
                instructions and verify that each part is complete.
            </p>

                If any part of the assignment seems to conflict with this checklist, ask for clarification in the class forums.
