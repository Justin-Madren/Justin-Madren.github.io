            <h3>Frequently Asked Question</h3>
            <h4>What do you offer for children during worship</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>We offer Children’s Sunday School at 10:00 AM for kids ages 3 through 5th grade, where they can learn about God's love through engaging lessons and activities.</li>
                <li>During the worship service, children are invited to join in a special Children’s Sermon, followed by Children’s Church, where they continue to explore the Bible in a fun, age-appropriate setting.</li>
                <li>A nursery is also available for infants and toddlers, so parents can enjoy the service knowing their little ones are cared for in a safe and loving environment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>How Should I Dress</h4>
            <p>There is no dress code here. You simply come as you are. We are more concerned with you being conformed to the image of Christ and living out His truth than influencing your fashion. You will see people wearing shorts and polo shirts as well as people in suit and ties. No matter what you are wearing, you are loved and wanted.</p>
            <h4>What's The Worship Like</h4>
            <p>We offer a blended mix that consists of contemporary praise and worship music and hymns.</p>
            <h4>Will I ever be singled out</h4>
            <p>All guests are welcomed by our amazing family of Christ followers. If you are new or visiting, you will be sure to leave Lakeview feeling the love of God through His people.</p>
