            <h2>About Lakeview Community Church</h2>
            <p>
                Lakeview Community Church was founded in the summer of 1952 when a small group of faithful 
                believers gathered for worship in the Glencoe School. With only borrowed equipment and an 
                abundance of faith, Rev. John Truitt Jr., his wife Delores, and others began what would 
                soon grow into a lasting ministry. Guided by the Holy Spirit, the congregation laid both 
                a physical and spiritual cornerstone in Jesus Christ. Within months, land was donated, a 
                simple cement block building was raised, and the first service was held in March 1953. 
                Over the decades, Lakeview has continued to grow—adding classrooms, a parsonage, and the 
                Family Life Center—each step reflecting God’s blessings and the dedication of His people. 
                Today, the church remains a vibrant community of believers committed to worship, fellowship,
                and service, still guided by the same spirit that inspired its humble beginnings.
