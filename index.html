			<h2>About Justin Madren</h2>
			<p>
				I will be graduating UNCC in the Fall of 2026 with a Degree in Computer Science with a 
				consteration in cyber security. I have planes to presue a masters in cyber security 
				by geting into the early access program to get a head start on acaving that goal.
				I enjoy all things computers and learning more about them and under standing how they all work
				together. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I enjoy watching twitch streams and youtube video's and playing video games. My curent favorit game
				would have to be Balder's Gate 3 (BG3) it is a tern based combat game, it's basicly a Dnd video game.
